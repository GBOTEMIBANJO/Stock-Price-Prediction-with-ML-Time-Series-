Stock Price Prediction with ML (Time Series)
# 📈 Stock Price Forecasting using Time Series Analysis in Python

This project is based on the course *"Time Series Analysis for Finance in Python"* by Carl Gordon. It focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock prices using time series techniques like ARIMA and Facebook Prophet.

## 🧠 Objective
Predict stock price movements and trends using historical data and machine learning models to better understand financial market dynamics.

Lesson 1 - Introduction to Time Series in Finance
Open in Colab

Time series = sequence of data points over time (e.g., stock prices)

Importance: uncovers patterns, supports predictions

Python visualization using pandas and matplotlib

📘 Lesson 2 - Importing & Cleaning Financial Data
Open in Colab

Import financial data using pandas_datareader from Yahoo Finance

Handle missing values with forward fill

Clean and prepare reliable data for analysis

📘 Lesson 3 - Basic Time Series Patterns
Open in Colab

Recognize Trend, Seasonality, and Cycles

Visualize synthetic stock prices and annotate patterns

Understand financial behavior through plotted insights

📘 Lesson 4 - Time Series Decomposition
Open in Colab

Break time series into:

Trend (long-term movement)

Seasonal (repetitive short-term patterns)

Residual (random noise)

Use statsmodels to visualize each component

📘 Lesson 5 - Moving Averages & Smoothing
Open in Colab

Filter noise to reveal trends

Compare SMA (Simple Moving Average) vs. EMA (Exponential)

Python plots to show smoothing effects

📘 Lesson 6 - Autocorrelation & Its Significance
Open in Colab

Measure internal correlation of time series

Use plot_acf() to visualize lags

Applications:

Detect seasonality

Test market efficiency

Prepare for model selection

📘 Lesson 7 - Stationarity in Time Series
Open in Colab

Stationary data = consistent mean/variance over time

Essential for forecasting accuracy

Run Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to assess stationarity

📘 Lesson 8 - Forecasting with ARIMA
Open in Colab

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):

AR: uses past values

I: differencing for stationarity

MA: corrects prediction errors

Forecast future stock prices using Python’s ARIMA model

📘 Lesson 9 - Forecasting with Facebook Prophet
Open in Colab

Built for time series with strong seasonality & holidays

Easy to use, handles missing values, changepoints

Process:

Format data (ds, y)

Fit model and forecast

Visualize predictions with uncertainty intervals

🛠️ Lesson 10 - Build Your Own Forecast (Coming Soon!)
In development

Combine all concepts from previous lessons to build your own end-to-end forecasting solution.
